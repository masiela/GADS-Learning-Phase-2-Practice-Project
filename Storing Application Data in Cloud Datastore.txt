Examining the Case Study Application Code
In this section, you will use the Cloud Shell text editor to review the case study application code.

Employ the Cloud Shell Editor
From Cloud Shell, click Launch code editor.
The Orion integrated code editor will launch in a separate tab of your browser, along with Cloud Shell.

Navigate to the /training-data-analyst/courses/developingapps/nodejs/datastore/start/server folder using the file browser panel on the left side of the editor.
The application is a standard Node.js application written using the popular Express application framework.

Review the Express Web application
Select the .../datastore/start/server/app.js file.
This file contains the entrypoint for the Express application and registers the main application routes for creating questions and delivering quizzes to users.

Select the .../datastore/start/server/web-app folder.
This folder contains the Node.js modules for the server-side web application.

Select the .../datastore/start/server/web-app/questions.js file.
This file contains the handlers that display the form and collect form data posted by quiz authors in the web application.

In the questions.js file, find the handler that responds to HTTP POST requests for the /questions/add route.
Review the source code comments for a detailed description of this handler's functionality.

Select the .../datastore/start/server/web-app/views folder.
This folder contains templates for the web application user interface using the pug (formerly jade) layout engine.

View the .../datastore/start/server/web-app/views/questions/add.pug file.
This file contains the pug template for the Create Question form.

Notice how there is a select list to pick a quiz, textboxes where an author can enter the question and answers, and radio buttons to select the correct answer.

Select the .../datastore/start/server/api/index.js file.
This file contains the handler that sends JSON data to students taking a test.

Notice that the handlers also make use of the model object.

Select the .../datastore/start/server/gcp/datastore.js file.
This is the file where you will write Datastore code to save and load quiz questions to and from Cloud Datastore.

This module will be imported into the web application and API as the model object for the web application and API

Adding Entities to Cloud Datastore
In this section, you will write code to save form data in Cloud Datastore.

Important: Update code within the sections marked as follows:

// TODO

// END TODO

To maximize your learning, try to write the code without reference to the completed code block at the end of the section. In addition, review the code, inline comments, and related API documentation.

You can view the API documentation for Cloud Datastore at:

https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-node/#/docs/datastore

Create an App Engine application to provision Cloud Datastore
Return to Cloud Shell and stop the application by pressing Ctrl+C.

To create an App Engine application in your project, execute the following command in Cloud Shell:

gcloud app create --region "us-central"
Note: You aren't using App Engine for your web application yet.

However, Cloud Datastore requires you to create an App Engine application in your project.

Import and use the NodeJS Datastore module
Open the ...gcp/datastore.js file in the Cloud Shell editor.

Load the config module from the parent folder.

Load the @google-cloud/datastore module.

Declare a Datastore client object named ds.

datastore.js
// TODO: Load the ../config module

const config = require('../config');

// END TODO

// TODO: Load the @google-cloud/datastore module

const Datastore = require('@google-cloud/datastore');

// END TODO

// TODO: Create a Datastore client object, ds
// The Datastore(...) factory function accepts an options // object which is used to specify which project's
// Datastore should be used via the projectId property.
// The projectId is retrieved from the config module. This // module retrieves the project ID from the GCLOUD_PROJECT // environment variable.

const ds = Datastore({
 projectId: config.get('GCLOUD_PROJECT')
});

// END TODO

Write code to create a Cloud Datastore entity
Declare a constant named kind, initialized with the value 'Question'.

datastore.js
// TODO: Declare a constant named kind
//The Datastore key is the equivalent of a primary key in a // relational database.
// There are two main ways of writing a key:
// 1. Specify the kind, and let Datastore generate a unique //    numeric id
// 2. Specify the kind and a unique string id

const kind = 'Question';

// END TODO

In the create(...) function, remove the existing Promise.resolve({}) placeholder statement from the create(...) function.

Declare a constant called key to store the key for this entity.

Declare a constant named entity and initialize it with the key and the quiz question properties extracted from the form data.

Use the Datastore client object (ds) to save the entity by calling the save(entity) method.

datastore.js
// The create({quiz, author, title, answer1, answer2,
// answer3, answer4, correctAnswer}) function uses an
// ECMAScript 2015 destructuring assignment to extract
// properties from the form data passed to the function

function create({ quiz, author, title, answer1, answer2,
                  answer3, answer4, correctAnswer }) {
 // TODO: Declare the entity key,
 // with a Datastore generated id

 const key = ds.key(kind);

 // END TODO

 // TODO: Declare the entity object, with the key and data

 const entity = {
   key,
// The entity's members are represented in a data property.
// This is an array where each element represents one
// member in the entity. Each element is an object with a // name and a value
   data: [
     { name: 'quiz', value: quiz },
     { name: 'author', value: author },
     { name: 'title', value: title },
     { name: 'answer1', value: answer1 },
     { name: 'answer2', value: answer2 },
     { name: 'answer3', value: answer3 },
     { name: 'answer4', value: answer4 },
     { name: 'correctAnswer', value: correctAnswer },
   ]
 };
 // END TODO

// TODO: Save the entity, return a promise
 // The ds.save(...) method returns a Promise to the
 // caller, as it runs asynchronously.

 return ds.save(entity);

 // END TODO
}

Bonus: Querying Cloud Datastore
In this section, you will write code to retrieve entity data from Cloud Datastore.

Write code to retrieve Cloud Datastore entities
Return to the code editor.

In the ...gcp/datastore.js file, remove the code from the list(quiz)method.

In the list(...) method, a query that retrieves Question entities for a specific quiz from Cloud Datastore.

Use the Datastore client to run the query, and assign the returned promise object to a constant.

Write a statement to return the promise.

Chain a then(...) method to the promise.

Write an arrow function in the then(...) method to retrieve the response from Cloud Datastore.

In the arrow function extract the results from the response.

Reshape the data by adding each entity ID and removing the correct answer from the data returned from Cloud Datastore.

Complete the code in the arrow function body to return a page of entities or an object that indicates that this is the last page of results.

Run the application and test the Cloud Datastore query
Save the ...gcp/datastore.js file, and then return to the Cloud Shell command.
Stop the application by pressing Ctrl+C.
Start the application.
In Cloud Shell, click Web preview > Preview on port 8080 to preview the quiz application.
